            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```bash
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.13/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```bash
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.13/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ### Security fixes

            [CVE-2022-39222](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw) is a backchannel attack against
            the Dex OIDC provider. If you are impacted Argo CD, an attacker could use the process described in the
            [vulnerability description](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c) to steal an Argo CD
            token from some Argo CD user. The attacker could then impersonate the targeted user and act with the victim's privileges.

            #### Am I impacted?

            This Dex vulnerability impacts Argo CD users who either
            1) use the bundled Dex instance for OIDC or 2) use an external Dex instance running Dex <= 2.34.x.

            If you do not use Dex, then you are not impacted.

            ##### Bundled Dex

            To determine if you use the bundled Dex instance, run this command, replacing `argocd` with the namespace where your
            Argo CD instance is installed:

            ```shell
            kubectl get cm -n argocd argocd-cm -ojson | jq '.data["dex.config"] != null'
            ```

            If that command prints `true`, then you use the bundled Dex instance, and you should upgrade.

            ##### External Dex

            To determine if you use an external Dex instance, run this command:

            ```shell
            kubectl get cm -n argocd argocd-cm -ojson | jq '.data["oidc.config"]'
            ```

            That will print your Argo CD instance's OIDC config. It might be obvious whether the OIDC provider is Dex (for example,
            the word `dex` might be in the URL). Or you might have to contact whoever manages the configured OIDC provider to ask.

            You will also have to check with whoever manages the Dex instance to determine if it is still running a vulnerable
            version (<= 2.34.x).

            #### How can I resolve the vulnerability as a user of the bundled Dex instance?

            Upgrading Dex is the only way to resolve the vulnerability.

            If you're using the manifests from the argo-cd repository to install Argo CD, the easiest way to resolve the
            vulnerability is to use the latest release's manifests, which point to the Dex 2.35.0 image. If you do not want to
            upgrade the full manifest, then you can manually change the Dex image tags in you're deployed manifests to use a
            >= 2.35.0 tag.

            If you're using the [argo-helm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm) argo-cd chart, you can either wait for a new
            chart release which points to the new Dex version, or you can set the `dex.image.tag` parameter to a >= 2.35.0 tag.

            To confirm that you are using a patched version of Dex, use this command (replacing `argocd` with the namespace where
            your Argo CD instance is deployed):

            ```shell
            kubectl get deployment -n argocd argocd-dex-server -ojson | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image'
            ```

            The image tag should point to a Dex version >= 2.35.0.

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.5.6/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell

            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.3/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.4/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.4/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.


            ## Upgrading

            If upgrading from a different minor version, be sure to read the [upgrading](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/) documentation.

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.6/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.7/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.7/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.9/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.7.9/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.8.1/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.8.1/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.


            ## Upgrading

            If upgrading from a different minor version, be sure to read the [upgrading](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/) documentation.

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.8.4/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.8.4/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.8.6/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.8.6/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.


            ## Upgrading

            If upgrading from a different minor version, be sure to read the [upgrading](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/) documentation.

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.9.1/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.9.1/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.


            ## Upgrading

            If upgrading from a different minor version, be sure to read the [upgrading](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/) documentation.

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.9.3/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.9.3/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release Signatures and Provenance

            All Argo CD container images are signed by cosign.  A Provenance is generated for container images and CLI binaries which meet the SLSA Level 3 specifications. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets) on how to verify.


            ## Upgrading

            If upgrading from a different minor version, be sure to read the [upgrading](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/) documentation.

          body: "Helm v3.11.1 is a security (patch) release. Users are strongly recommended
            to update to this release.\r\n\r\nThe template function `getHostByName`
            can be used to disclose information. More details are available in the
            [CVE](https://github.com/helm/helm/security/advisories/GHSA-pwcw-6f5g-gxf8).\r\n\r\nThis
            release introduces a breaking changes to Helm:\r\n\r\n* When using the
            `helm` client for the `template`, `install`, and `upgrade` commands there
            is a new flag. `--enable-dns` needs to be set for the `getHostByName`
            template function to attempt to lookup an IP address for a given hostname.
            If the flag is not set the template function will return an empty string
            and skip looping up an IP address for the host.\r\n* The Helm SDK has
            added the `EnableDNS` property to the install action, the upgrade action,
            and the `Engine`. This property must be set to true for the in order for
            the `getHostByName` template function to attempt to lookup an IP address.\r\n\r\nThe
            default for both of these cases is false.\r\n\r\n[Philipp Stehle](https://github.com/phil9909)
            at SAP disclosed the vulnerability to the Helm project.\r\n\r\n## Installation

          body: "Helm v3.13.0 is a feature release. Users are encouraged to upgrade
            for the best experience.\r\n\r\nThe community keeps growing, and we'd
            love to see you there!\r\n\r\n- Join the discussion in [Kubernetes Slack](https://kubernetes.slack.com):\r\n
            \ -  for questions and just to hang out\r\n  -  for discussing PRs, code,
            and bugs\r\n- Hang out at the Public Developer Call: Thursday, 9:30 Pacific
            via [Zoom](https://zoom.us/j/696660622)\r\n- Test, debug, and contribute
            charts: [ArtifactHub/packages](https://artifacthub.io/packages/search?kind=0)\r\n\r\n##
            Notable Changes\r\n\r\n- The `--dry-run` flag now has multiple options
            which can enable Helm to connect to a Kubernetes instance. The default,
            when `--dry-run` is used, is unchanged.\r\n- Values handling had numerous
            issues fixed and now consistently has a priority of (1) User specified
            values (e.g CLI), (2) imported values, (3) parent chart values, and (4)
            subchart values. Additionally, null can now consistently be used to remove
            values.\r\n- Can work with OCI registries over HTTP using the `--plain-http`
            flag\r\n- Helm now adds the OCI creation annotation\r\n- New `helm get
            metadata` command\r\n- The SQL driver now only needs write on the first
            run or when the schema is updated\r\n- Added labels support for install
            and upgrade commands\r\n\r\n## Installation and Upgrading\r\n\r\nDownload
