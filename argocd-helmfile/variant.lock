      body: "We introduced a new Helmfile V1 mode that can be enabled via an environment
        variable and a build flag. It allows you to build a Helmfile V1 binary from
        the same source tree and even enabling the V1 mode at runtime via an environment
        variable.\r\n\r\nThe new V1 mode and upcoming Helmfile v1 releases have some
        breaking changes like the .gotmpl extension is required to let Helmfile render
        the helmfile.yaml as a template. See the V1 proposal for more information.\r\n\r\nWe
        also reverted our YAML library to `gopkg.in/yaml.v2` and introduced `goccy/go-yaml`
        for the Helmfile V1 mode. You can opt-in for the V1 mode or enable the new
        YAML library via environment variables.\r\n\r\nIf you've been struggling with
        managing and repeating common fields across releases, or worked-around that
        by either leveraging helmfile templates(not release templates) or layering
        `values` and `valuesTemplate` (although it wasn't the intended usage), the
        new `inherit` field would be handy. It allows you to layer any number of release
        templates. \r\n\r\nThe last and most important change is that we finally dropped
        the Helm v2 support! Helm v2 has been unmaintained since 2020, and no one
        should be using it anymore.\r\n\r\nSee the related pull request descriptions
        and comments for more information!\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* Clarify postsync
        hooks docs by @felipecrs in https://github.com/helmfile/helmfile/pull/585\r\n*

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```bash
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.13/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```bash
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.4.13/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ### Security fixes

            [CVE-2022-39222](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c-j2cw) is a backchannel attack against
            the Dex OIDC provider. If you are impacted Argo CD, an attacker could use the process described in the
            [vulnerability description](https://github.com/dexidp/dex/security/advisories/GHSA-vh7g-p26c) to steal an Argo CD
            token from some Argo CD user. The attacker could then impersonate the targeted user and act with the victim's privileges.

            #### Am I impacted?

            This Dex vulnerability impacts Argo CD users who either
            1) use the bundled Dex instance for OIDC or 2) use an external Dex instance running Dex <= 2.34.x.

            If you do not use Dex, then you are not impacted.

            ##### Bundled Dex

            To determine if you use the bundled Dex instance, run this command, replacing `argocd` with the namespace where your
            Argo CD instance is installed:

            ```shell
            kubectl get cm -n argocd argocd-cm -ojson | jq '.data["dex.config"] != null'
            ```

            If that command prints `true`, then you use the bundled Dex instance, and you should upgrade.

            ##### External Dex

            To determine if you use an external Dex instance, run this command:

            ```shell
            kubectl get cm -n argocd argocd-cm -ojson | jq '.data["oidc.config"]'
            ```

            That will print your Argo CD instance's OIDC config. It might be obvious whether the OIDC provider is Dex (for example,
            the word `dex` might be in the URL). Or you might have to contact whoever manages the configured OIDC provider to ask.

            You will also have to check with whoever manages the Dex instance to determine if it is still running a vulnerable
            version (<= 2.34.x).

            #### How can I resolve the vulnerability as a user of the bundled Dex instance?

            Upgrading Dex is the only way to resolve the vulnerability.

            If you're using the manifests from the argo-cd repository to install Argo CD, the easiest way to resolve the
            vulnerability is to use the latest release's manifests, which point to the Dex 2.35.0 image. If you do not want to
            upgrade the full manifest, then you can manually change the Dex image tags in you're deployed manifests to use a
            >= 2.35.0 tag.

            If you're using the [argo-helm](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-helm) argo-cd chart, you can either wait for a new
            chart release which points to the new Dex version, or you can set the `dex.image.tag` parameter to a >= 2.35.0 tag.

            To confirm that you are using a patched version of Dex, use this command (replacing `argocd` with the namespace where
            your Argo CD instance is deployed):

            ```shell
            kubectl get deployment -n argocd argocd-dex-server -ojson | jq '.spec.template.spec.containers[0].image'
            ```

            The image tag should point to a Dex version >= 2.35.0.

            ## Quick Start

            ### Non-HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.5.6/manifests/install.yaml
            ```

            ### HA:

            ```shell
            kubectl create namespace argocd
            kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/v2.5.6/manifests/ha/install.yaml
            ```

            ## Release signatures

            All Argo CD container images and CLI binaries are signed by cosign. See the [documentation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/signed-release-assets/) on how to verify the signatures.
            ```shell
