        ## 1.2.6 (July 27, 2022)

        ENHANCEMENTS:

        * Add a warning and guidance when `terraform init` fails to fully populate the `.terraform.lock.hcl` file. ([#31399](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31399))
        * Add a direct link to the relevant documentation when `terraform init` fails on missing checksums. ([#31408](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31408))

        BUG FIXES:

        * Fix panic on `terraform show` when state file is invalid or unavailable. ([#31444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31444))
        * Fix `terraform providers lock` command failing on missing checksums. ([#31389](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31389))
        * Some combinations of move block operations would be executed in the wrong order ([#31499](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31499))
        * Don't attribute an error to the provider when a computed attribute is listed in `ignore_changes` ([#31509](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31509))
