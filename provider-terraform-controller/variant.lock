            BUG FIXES:

            * config: The `flatten` function will no longer panic if given a null value that has been explicitly converted to or implicitly inferred as having a list, set, or tuple type. Previously Terraform would panic in such a situation because it tried to "flatten" the contents of the null value into the result, which is impossible. ([#31675](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31675))
            * config: The `tolist`, `toset`, and `tomap` functions, and various automatic conversions that include similar logic, will no longer panic when asked to infer an element type that is convertable from both a tuple type and a list type whose element type is not yet known.

            ## 1.3.0 (September 21, 2022)

            NEW FEATURES:

            * **Optional attributes for object type constraints:** When declaring an input variable whose type constraint includes an object type, you can now declare individual attributes as optional, and specify a default value to use if the caller doesn't set it. For example:

                ```terraform
                variable "with_optional_attribute" {
                  type = object({
                    a = string                # a required attribute
                    b = optional(string)      # an optional attribute
                    c = optional(number, 127) # an optional attribute with a default value
                  })
                }
                ```

                Assigning `{ a = "foo" }` to this variable will result in the value `{ a = "foo", b = null, c = 127 }`.

            * Added functions: `startswith` and `endswith` allow you to check whether a given string has a specified prefix or suffix. ([#31220](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31220))

            UPGRADE NOTES:

            * `terraform show -json`: Output changes now include more detail about the unknown-ness of the planned value. Previously, a planned output would be marked as either fully known or partially unknown, with the `after_unknown` field having value `false` or `true` respectively. Now outputs correctly expose the full structure of unknownness for complex values, allowing consumers of the JSON output format to determine which values in a collection are known only after apply.
            * `terraform import`: The `-allow-missing-config` has been removed, and at least an empty configuration block must exist to import a resource.
            * Consumers of the JSON output format expecting on the `after_unknown` field to be only `false` or `true` should be updated to support [the change representation](https://www.terraform.io/internals/json-format#change-representation) described in the documentation, and as was already used for resource changes. ([#31235](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31235))
            * AzureRM Backend: This release concludes [the deprecation cycle started in Terraform v1.1](https://www.terraform.io/language/upgrade-guides/1-1#preparation-for-removing-azure-ad-graph-support-in-the-azurerm-backend) for the `azurerm` backend's support of "ADAL" authentication. This backend now supports only "MSAL" (Microsoft Graph) authentication.

                This follows from [Microsoft's own deprecation of Azure AD Graph](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/migrate-azure-ad-graph-faq), and so you must follow the migration instructions presented in that Azure documentation to adopt Microsoft Graph and then change your backend configuration to use MSAL authentication before upgrading to Terraform v1.3.
            * When making requests to HTTPS servers, Terraform will now reject invalid handshakes that have duplicate extensions, as required by RFC 5246 section 7.4.1.4 and RFC 8446 section 4.2. This may cause new errors when interacting with existing buggy or misconfigured TLS servers, but should not affect correct servers.

                This only applies to requests made directly by Terraform CLI, such as provider installation and remote state storage. Terraform providers are separate programs which decide their own policy for handling of TLS handshakes.
            * The following backends, which were deprecated in v1.2.3, have now been removed: `artifactory`, `etcd`, `etcdv3`, `manta`, `swift`. The legacy backend name `azure` has also been removed, because the current Azure backend is named `azurerm`. ([#31711](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31711))

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * config: Optional attributes for object type constraints, as described under new features above. ([#31154](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31154))
            * config: New built-in function `timecmp` allows determining the ordering relationship between two timestamps while taking potentially-different UTC offsets into account. ([#31687](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/31687))
            * config: When reporting an error message related to a function call, Terraform will now include contextual information about the signature of the function that was being called, as an aid to understanding why the call might have failed. ([#31299](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31299))
            * config: When reporting an error or warning message that isn't caused by values being unknown or marked as sensitive, Terraform will no longer mention any values having those characteristics in the contextual information presented alongside the error. Terraform will still return this information for the small subset of error messages that are specifically about unknown values or sensitive values being invalid in certain contexts. ([#31299](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31299))
            * config: `moved` blocks can now describe resources moving to and from modules in separate module packages. ([#31556](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31556))
            * `terraform fmt` now accepts multiple target paths, allowing formatting of several individual files at once. ([#31687](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31687))
            * `terraform init`: provider installation errors now mention which host Terraform was downloading from ([#31524](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31524))
            * CLI: Terraform will report more explicitly when it is proposing to delete an object due to it having moved to a resource instance that is not currently declared in the configuration. ([#31695](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31695))
            * CLI: When showing the progress of a remote operation running in Terraform Cloud, Terraform CLI will include information about pre-plan run tasks ([#31617](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31617))
            * The AzureRM Backend now only supports MSAL (and Microsoft Graph) and no longer makes use of ADAL (and Azure Active Directory Graph) for authentication ([#31070](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31070))
            * The COS backend now supports global acceleration. ([#31425](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31425))
            * provider plugin protocol: The Terraform CLI now calls `PlanResourceChange` for compatible providers when destroying resource instances. ([#31179](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31179))
            * As an implementation detail of the Terraform Cloud integration, Terraform CLI will now capture and upload [the JSON integration format for state](https://www.terraform.io/internals/json-format#state-representation) along with any newly-recorded state snapshots, which then in turn allows Terraform Cloud to provide that information to API-based external integrations. ([#31698](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31698))

            BUG FIXES:

            * config: Terraform was not previously evaluating preconditions and postconditions during the apply phase for resource instances that didn't have any changes pending, which was incorrect because the outcome of a condition can potentially be affected by changes to _other_ objects in the configuration. Terraform will now always check the conditions for every resource instance included in a plan during the apply phase, even for resource instances that have "no-op" changes. This means that some failures that would previously have been detected only by a subsequent run will now be detected during the same run that caused them, thereby giving the feedback at the appropriate time. ([#31491](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31491))
            * `terraform show -json`: Fixed missing markers for unknown values in the encoding of partially unknown tuples and sets. ([#31236](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31236))
            * `terraform output` CLI help documentation is now more consistent with web-based documentation. ([#29354](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29354))
            * `terraform init`: Error messages now handle the situation where the underlying HTTP client library does not indicate a hostname for a failed request. ([#31542](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31542))
            * `terraform init`: Don't panic if a child module contains a resource with a syntactically-invalid resource type name. ([#31573](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31573))
            * CLI: The representation of destroying already-`null` output values in a destroy plan will no longer report them as being deleted, which avoids reporting the deletion of an output value that was already absent. ([#31471](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31471))
            * `terraform import`: Better handling of resources or modules that use `for_each`, and situations where data resources are needed to complete the operation. ([#31283](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31283))

            EXPERIMENTS:

            * This release concludes the `module_variable_optional_attrs` experiment, which started in Terraform v0.14.0. The final design of the optional attributes feature is similar to the experimental form in the previous releases, but with two major differences:
                * The `optional` function-like modifier for declaring an optional attribute now accepts an optional second argument for specifying a default value to use when the attribute isn't set by the caller. If not specified, the default value is a null value of the appropriate type as before.
                * The built-in `defaults` function, previously used to meet the use-case of replacing null values with default values, will not graduate to stable and has been removed. Use the second argument of `optional` inline in your type constraint to declare default values instead.

                If you have any experimental modules that were participating in this experiment, you will need to remove the experiment opt-in and adopt the new syntax for declaring default values in order to migrate your existing module to the stablized version of this feature. If you are writing a shared module for others to use, we recommend declaring that your module requires Terraform v1.3.0 or later to give specific feedback when using the new feature on older Terraform versions, in place of the previous declaration to use the experimental form of this feature:

                ```hcl
                terraform {
                  required_version = ">= 1.3.0"
                }
                ```

            ## 1.3.1 (September 28, 2022)

            NOTE:
            * On `darwin/amd64` and `darwin/arm64` architectures, `terraform` binaries are now built with CGO enabled. This should not have any user-facing impact, except in cases where the pure Go DNS resolver causes problems on recent versions of macOS: using CGO may mitigate these issues. Please see the upstream bug https://github.com/golang/go/issues/52839 for more details.

            BUG FIXES:

            * Fixed a crash when using objects with optional attributes and default values in collections, most visible with nested modules. ([#31847](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31847))
            * Prevent cycles in some situations where a provider depends on resources in the configuration which are participating in planned changes. ([#31857](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31857))
            * Fixed an error when attempting to destroy a configuration where resources do not exist in the state. ([#31858](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31858))
            * Data sources which cannot be read during will no longer prevent the state from being serialized. ([#31871](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31871))
            * Fixed a crash which occured when a resource with a precondition and/or a postcondition appeared inside a module with two or more instances. ([#31860](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31860))

            BUG FIXES:

            * Prevent errors when the provider reports that a deposed instance no longer exists ([#31902](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31902))
            * Using `ignore_changes = all` could cause persistent diffs with legacy providers ([#31914](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31914))
            * Fix cycles when resource dependencies cross over between independent provider configurations ([#31917](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31917))

            ## 1.3.4 (November 02, 2022)

            BUG FIXES:

            * Fix invalid refresh-only plan caused by data sources being deferred to apply ([#32111](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32111))
            * Optimize the handling of condition checks during apply to prevent performance regressions with large numbers of instances ([#32123](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32123))
            * Output preconditions should not be evaluated during destroy ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
            * Fix crash from `console` when outputs contain preconditions ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
            * Destroy with no state would still attempt to evaluate some values ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
            * Prevent unnecessary evaluation and planning of resources during the pre-destroy refresh ([#32051](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32051))
            * AzureRM Backend: support for generic OIDC authentication via the `oidc_token` and `oidc_token_file_path` properties ([#31966](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31966))
            * Input and Module Variables: Convert variable types before attempting to apply default values. ([#32027](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32027))
            * When installing remote module packages delivered in tar format, Terraform now limits the tar header block size to 1MiB to avoid unbounded memory usage for maliciously-crafted module packages. ([#32135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32135))
            * Terraform will now reject excessively-complex regular expression patterns passed to the `regex`, `regexall`, and `replace` functions, to avoid unbounded memory usage for maliciously-crafted patterns. This change should not affect any reasonable patterns intended for practical use. ([#32135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32135))
            * Terraform on Windows now rejects invalid environment variables whose values contain the NUL character when propagating environment variables to a child process such as a provider plugin. Previously Terraform would incorrectly treat that character as a separator between two separate environment variables. ([#32135](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32135))

            * Allow a destroy plan to refresh instances while taking into account that some may no longer exist ([#32208](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32208))
            * Fix Terraform creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
            * Fix several Terraform crashes that are caused by HCL creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects within collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
            * Fix inconsistent behaviour in empty vs null collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
            * Prevent file uploads from creating unneeded temporary files when the payload size is known ([#32206](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32206))
            * Nested attributes marked sensitive by schema no longer reveal sub-attributes in the plan diff ([#32004](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32004))
            * Nested attributes now more consistently display when they become unknown or null values in the plan diff ([#32004](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32004))
            * Sensitive values are now always displayed as `(sensitive value)` instead of sometimes as `(sensitive)` [GH32004]

            ## 1.3.8 (February 09, 2023)

            BUG FIXES:

            * Fixed a rare bug causing inaccurate `before_sensitive` / `after_sensitive` annotations in JSON plan output for deeply nested structures. This was only observed in the wild on the rancher/rancher2 provider, and resulted in glitched display in Terraform Cloud's structured plan log view. ([#32543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32543))
            * A variable only referenced by an output precondition error_message may be missing during evaluation ([#32464](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32464))
            * Removing a NestingSingle block from configuration results in an invalid plan ([#32463](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32463))
            * Null module outputs could be dropped, causing evaluation errors when referring to those module attributes ([#32583](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32583))

            ## 1.4.0 (March 08, 2023)

            UPGRADE NOTES:

            * config: The `textencodebase64` function when called with encoding "GB18030" will now encode the euro symbol € as the two-byte sequence `0xA2,0xE3`, as required by the GB18030 standard, before applying base64 encoding.
            * config: The `textencodebase64` function when called with encoding "GBK" or "CP936" will now encode the euro symbol € as the single byte `0x80` before applying base64 encoding. This matches the behavior of the Windows API when encoding to this Windows-specific character encoding.
            * `terraform init`: When interpreting the hostname portion of a provider source address or the address of a module in a module registry, Terraform will now use _non-transitional_ IDNA2008 mapping rules instead of the transitional mapping rules previously used.

                This matches a change to [the WHATWG URL spec's rules for interpreting non-ASCII domain names](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-domain-to-ascii) which is being gradually adopted by web browsers. Terraform aims to follow the interpretation of hostnames used by web browsers for consistency. For some hostnames containing non-ASCII characters this may cause Terraform to now request a different "punycode" hostname when resolving.
            * `terraform init` will now ignore entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. This therefore avoids the long-standing problem that when installing a new provider for the first time from the cache we can't determine the full set of checksums to include in the lock file. Once the lock file has been updated to include a checksum covering the item in the global cache, Terraform will then use the cache entry for subsequent installation of the same provider package. There is an interim CLI configuration opt-out for those who rely on the previous incorrect behavior. ([#32129](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32129))
            * The Terraform plan renderer has been completely rewritten to aid with future Terraform Cloud integration. Users should not see any material change in the plan output between 1.3 and 1.4. If you notice any significant differences, or if Terraform fails to plan successfully due to rendering problems, please open a bug report issue.

            BUG FIXES:

            * The module installer will now record in its manifest a correct module source URL after normalization when the URL given as input contains both a query string portion and a subdirectory portion. Terraform itself doesn't currently make use of this information and so this is just a cosmetic fix to make the recorded metadata more correct. ([#31636](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31636))
            * config: The `yamldecode` function now correctly handles entirely-nil YAML documents. Previously it would incorrectly return an unknown value instead of a null value. It will now return a null value as documented. ([#32151](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32151))
            * Ensure correct ordering between data sources and the deletion of managed resource dependencies. ([#32209](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32209))
            * Fix Terraform creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
            * Fix several Terraform crashes that are caused by HCL creating objects that should not exist in variables that specify default attributes in optional objects within collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
            * Fix inconsistent behaviour in empty vs null collections. ([#32178](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32178))
            * `terraform workspace` now returns a non-zero exit when given an invalid argument ([#31318](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31318))
            * Terraform would always plan changes when using a nested set attribute ([#32536](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32536))
            * Terraform can now better detect when complex optional+computed object attributes are removed from configuration ([#32551](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32551))
            * A new methodology for planning set elements can now better detect optional+computed changes within sets ([#32563](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32563))
            * Fix state locking and releasing messages when in `-json` mode, messages will now be written in JSON format ([#32451](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32451))


            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * `terraform plan` can now store a plan file even when encountering errors, which can later be inspected to help identify the source of the failures ([#32395](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32395))
            * `terraform_data` is a new builtin managed resource type, which can replace the use of `null_resource`, and can store data of any type ([#31757](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31757))
            * `terraform init` will now ignore entries in the optional global provider cache directory unless they match a checksum already tracked in the current configuration's dependency lock file. This therefore avoids the long-standing problem that when installing a new provider for the first time from the cache we can't determine the full set of checksums to include in the lock file. Once the lock file has been updated to include a checksum covering the item in the global cache, Terraform will then use the cache entry for subsequent installation of the same provider package. There is an interim CLI configuration opt-out for those who rely on the previous incorrect behavior. ([#32129](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32129))
            * Interactive input for sensitive variables is now masked in the UI ([#29520](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29520))
            * A new `-or-create` flag was added to `terraform workspace select`, to aid in creating workspaces in automated situations ([#31633](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31633))
            * A new command was added for exporting Terraform function signatures in machine-readable format: `terraform metadata functions -json` ([#32487](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32487))
            * The "Failed to install provider" error message now includes the reason a provider could not be installed. ([#31898](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31898))
            * backend/gcs: Add `kms_encryption_key` argument, to allow encryption of state files using Cloud KMS keys. ([#24967](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24967))
            * backend/gcs: Add `storage_custom_endpoint` argument, to allow communication with the backend via a Private Service Connect endpoint. ([#28856](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28856))
            * backend/gcs: Update documentation for usage of `gcs` with `terraform_remote_state` ([#32065](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32065))
            * backend/gcs: Update storage package to v1.28.0 ([#29656](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/29656))
            * When removing a workspace from the `cloud` backend `terraform workspace delete` will use Terraform Cloud's [Safe Delete](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/api-docs/workspaces#safe-delete-a-workspace) API if the `-force` flag is not provided. ([#31949](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/31949))
            * backend/oss: More robustly handle endpoint retrieval error ([#32295](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32295))
            * local-exec provisioner: Added `quiet` argument. If `quiet` is set to `true`, Terraform will not print the entire command to stdout during plan. ([#32116](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32116))
            * backend/http: Add support for mTLS authentication. ([#31699](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31699))
            * cloud: Add support for using the [generic hostname](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cloud-docs/registry/using#generic-hostname-terraform-enterprise) localterraform.com in module and provider sources as a substitute for the currently configured cloud backend hostname. This enhancement was also applied to the remote backend.
            * `terraform show` will now print an explanation when called on a Terraform workspace with empty state detailing why no resources are shown. ([#32629](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32629))
            * backend/gcs: Added support for `GOOGLE_BACKEND_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` env var to allow impersonating a different service account when `GOOGLE_IMPERSONATE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` is configured for the GCP provider. ([#32557](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32557))
            * backend/cos: Add support for the `assume_role` authentication method with the `tencentcloud` provider. This can be configured via the Terraform config or environment variables.
            * backend/cos: Add support for the `security_token` authentication method with the `tencentcloud` provider. This can be configured via the Terraform config or environment variables.

            EXPERIMENTS:

            * Since its introduction the `yamlencode` function's documentation carried a warning that it was experimental. This predated our more formalized idea of language experiments and so wasn't guarded by an explicit opt-in, but the intention was to allow for small adjustments to its behavior if we learned it was producing invalid YAML in some cases, due to the relative complexity of the YAML specification.

                From Terraform v1.4 onwards, `yamlencode` is no longer documented as experimental and is now subject to the Terraform v1.x Compatibility Promises. There are no changes to its previous behavior in v1.3 and so no special action is required when upgrading.

            ## 1.4.1 (March 15, 2023)

            BUG FIXES:

            * Enables overriding modules that have the `depends_on` attribute set, while still preventing the `depends_on` attribute itself from being overridden. ([#32796](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32796))
            * `terraform providers mirror`: when a dependency lock file is present, mirror the resolved providers versions, not the latest available based on configuration. ([#32749](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32749))
            * Fixed module downloads from S3 URLs when using AWS IAM roles for service accounts (IRSA). ([#32700](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32700))
            * hcl: Fix a crash in Terraform when attempting to apply defaults into an incompatible type. ([#32775](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32775))
            * Prevent panic when creating a plan which errors before the planning process has begun. ([#32818](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32818))
            * Fix the plan renderer skipping the "no changes" messages when there are no-op outputs within the plan. ([#32820](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32820))
            * Prevent panic when rendering null nested primitive values in a state output. ([#32840](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32840))
            * Warn when an invalid path is specified in `TF_CLI_CONFIG_FILE` ([#32846](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32846))

          body: "## 1.5.0 (June 12, 2023)\n\nNEW FEATURES:\n\n* `check` blocks for
            validating infrastructure: Module and configuration authors can now write
            independent check blocks within their configuration to validate assertions
            about their infrastructure.\n\n    The new independent `check` blocks
            must specify at least one `assert` block, but possibly many, each one
            with a `condition` expression and an `error_message` expression matching
            the existing [Custom Condition Checks](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.4.x/expressions/custom-conditions).
            \n    Additionally, check blocks can optionally load a scoped [data source](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.4.x/data-sources).
            Scoped data sources match the existing data sources with the exception
            that they can only be referenced from within their check block.\n\n    Unlike
            the existing `precondition` and `postcondition` blocks, Terraform will
            not halt execution should the scoped data block fail or error or if any
            of the assertions fail. \n    This allows practitioners to continually
            validate the state of their infrastructure outside the usual lifecycle
            management cycle. \n    \n* `import` blocks for importing infrastructure:
            Root module authors can now use the `import` block to declare their intent
            that Terraform adopt an existing resource. \n  \n    Import is now a configuration-driven,
            plannable action, and is processed as part of a normal plan. Running `terraform
            plan` will show a summary of the resources that Terraform has planned
            to import, along with any other plan changes. \n    \n    The existing
            `terraform import` CLI command has not been modified.\n    \n    This
            is an early version of the `import` block feature, for which we are actively
            seeking user feedback to shape future development. The `import` block
            currently does not support interpolation in the `id` field, which must
            be a string.\n\n* Generating configuration for imported resources: in
            conjunction with the `import` block, this feature enables easy templating
            of configuration when importing existing resources into Terraform. A new
            flag `-generate-config-out=PATH` is added to `terraform plan`. When this
            flag is set, Terraform will generate HCL configuration for any resource
            included in an `import` block that does not already have associated configuration,
            and write it to a new file at `PATH`. Before applying, review the generated
            configuration and edit it as necessary.\n\n* Adds a new `plantimestamp`
            function that returns the timestamp at plan time. This is similar to the
            `timestamp` function which returns the timestamp at apply time ([#32980](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/32980)).\n*
            Adds a new `strcontains` function that checks whether a given string contains
            a given substring. ([#33069](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33069))\n\n\nUPGRADE
            NOTES:\n\n* This is the last version of Terraform for which macOS 10.13
            High Sierra or 10.14 Mojave are officially supported. Future Terraform
            versions may not function correctly on these older versions of macOS.\n*
            This is the last version of Terraform for which Windows 7, 8, Server 2008,
            and Server 2012 are supported by Terraform's main implementation language,
            Go. We already ended explicit support for versions earlier than Windows
            10 in Terraform v0.15.0, but future Terraform versions may malfunction
            in more significant ways on these older Windows versions.\n* On Linux
            (and some other non-macOS Unix platforms we don't officially support),
            Terraform will now notice the `trust-ad` option in `/etc/resolv.conf`
            and, if set, will set the \"authentic data\" option in outgoing DNS requests
            in order to better match the behavior of the GNU libc resolver.\n\n    Terraform
            does not pay any attention to the corresponding option in responses, but
            some DNSSEC-aware recursive resolvers return different responses when
            the request option isn't set. This should therefore avoid some potential
            situations where a DNS request from Terraform might get a different response
            than a similar request from other software on your system.\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n*
            Terraform CLI's local operations mode will now attempt to persist state
            snapshots to the state storage backend periodically during the apply step,
            thereby reducing the window for lost data if the Terraform process is
            aborted unexpectedly. ([#32680](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32680))\n*
            If Terraform CLI receives SIGINT (or its equivalent on non-Unix platforms)
            during the apply step then it will immediately try to persist the latest
            state snapshot to the state storage backend, with the assumption that
            a graceful shutdown request often typically followed by a hard abort some
            time later if the graceful shutdown doesn't complete fast enough. ([#32680](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32680))\n*
            `pg` backend: Now supports the `PG_CONN_STR`, `PG_SCHEMA_NAME`, `PG_SKIP_SCHEMA_CREATION`,
            `PG_SKIP_TABLE_CREATION` and `PG_SKIP_INDEX_CREATION` environment variables.
            ([#33045](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33045))\n\nBUG
            FIXES:\n\n* `terraform init`: Fixed crash with invalid blank module name.
            ([#32781](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/32781))\n* `moved`
            blocks: Fixed a typo in the error message that Terraform raises when you
            use `-target` to exclude an object that has been moved. ([#33149](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33149))\n\n##

            ## 1.6.0 (October 4, 2023)

            UPGRADE NOTES:
            * On macOS, Terraform now requires macOS 10.15 Catalina or later; support for previous versions has been discontinued.
            * On Windows, Terraform now requires at least Windows 10 or Windows Server 2016; support for previous versions has been discontinued.
            * The S3 backend has a number of significant changes to its configuration format in this release, intended to match with recent changes in the `hashicorp/aws` provider:
                * Configuration settings related to assuming IAM roles now belong to a nested block `assume_role`. The top-level arguments `role_arn`, `session_name`, `external_id`, `assume_role_duration_seconds`, `assume_role_policy_arns`, `assume_role_tags`, and `assume_role_transitive_tag_keys` are all now deprecated in favor of the nested equivalents. ([#30495](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30495))
                * Configuration settings related to overriding the locations of AWS service endpoints used by the provider now belong to a nested block `endpoints`. The top-level arguments `dynamodb_endpoint`, `iam_endpoint`, `endpoint` (fir S3), and `sts_endpoint` are now deprecated in favor of the nested equivalents. ([#30492](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30492))
                * The backend now uses the following environment variables for overriding the default locations of AWS service endpoints used by the provider: `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_DYNAMODB`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_IAM`, `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`, and `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_STS`. The old non-standard names for these environment variables are now deprecated: `AWS_DYNAMODB_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_IAM_ENDPOINT`, `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`, and `AWS_STS_ENDPOINT`. ([#30479](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30479))
                * The singular `shared_credentials_file` argument is deprecated in favor of the plural `shared_credentials_files`.
                * The `force_path_style` argument is deprecated in favor of `use_path_style` for consistency with the AWS SDK. ([#30491](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30491))

            NEW FEATURES:
            * `terraform test`: The `terraform test` command is now generally available. This comes with a significant change to how tests are written and executed, based on feedback from the experimental phase.

                Terraform tests are written in `.tftest.hcl` files, containing a series of `run` blocks. Each `run` block executes a Terraform plan and optional apply against the Terraform configuration under test and can check conditions against the resulting plan and state.

            ENHANCEMENTS:
            * config: The `import` block `id` field now accepts expressions referring to other values such as resource attributes, as long as the value is a string known at plan time. ([#33618](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33618))
            * Terraform Cloud integration: Remote plans on Terraform Cloud/Enterprise can now be saved using the `-out` option, viewed using `terraform show`, and applied using `terraform apply` with the saved plan filename. ([#33492](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33492))
            * config: Terraform can now track some additional detail about values that won't be known until the apply step, such as the range of possible lengths for a collection or whether an unknown value can possibly be null.
            * core: Provider schemas can now be cached globally for compatible providers, allowing them to be reused throughout core without requesting them for each new provider instance. This can significantly reduce memory usage when there are many instances of the same provider in a single configuration ([#33482](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33482))

                When this information is available, Terraform can potentially generate known results for some operations on unknown values. This doesn't mean that Terraform can immediately track that detail in all cases, but the type system now supports that and so over time we can improve the level of detail generated by built-in functions, language operators, Terraform providers, etc. ([#33234](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33234))
            * config: The `try` and `can` functions can now return more precise and consistent results when faced with unknown arguments ([#33758](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33758))
            * `terraform show -json`: Now includes `errored` property, indicating whether the planning process halted with an error. An errored plan is not applyable. ([#33372](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33372))
            * core: Terraform will now skip requesting the (possibly very large) provider schema from providers which indicate during handshake that they don't require that for correct behavior, in situations where Terraform Core itself does not need the schema. ([#33486](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33486))
            * backend/kubernetes: The Kubernetes backend is no longer limited to storing states below 1MiB in size, and can now scale by splitting state across multiple secrets. ([#29678](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/29678))
            * backend/s3: Various improvements for consistency with `hashicorp/aws` provider capabilities:
                * `assume_role_with_web_identity` nested block for assuming a role with dynamic credentials such as a JSON Web Token. ([#31244](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31244))
                * Now honors the standard AWS environment variables for credential and configuration files: `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` and `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`. ([#30493](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30493))
                * `shared_config_files` and `shared_credentials_files` arguments for specifying credential and configuration files as part of the backend configuration. ([#30493](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30493))
                * Internally the backend now uses AWS SDK for Go v2, which should address various other missing behaviors that are handled by the SDK rather than by Terraform itself. ([#30443](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30443))
                * `custom_ca_bundle` argument and support for the corresponding AWS environment variable, `AWS_CA_BUNDLE`, for providing custom root and intermediate certificates. ([#33689](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33689))
                * `ec2_metadata_service_endpoint` and `ec2_metadata_service_endpoint_mode` arguments and support for the corresponding AWS environment variables, `AWS_EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_ENDPOINT` and `AWS_EC2_METADATA_SERVICE_ENDPOINT_MODE` for setting the EC2 metadata service (IMDS) endpoint. The environment variable `AWS_METADATA_URL` is also supported for compatibility with the AWS provider, but is deprecated. ([#30444](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30444))
                * `http_proxy`, `insecure`, `use_fips_endpoint`, and `use_dualstack_endpoint` arguments and support for the corresponding environment variables, `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY`, which enable custom HTTP proxy configurations and the resolution of AWS endpoints with extended capabilities. ([#30496](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/30496))
                * `sts_region` argument to use an alternative region for STS operations. ([#33693](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33693))
                * `retry_mode` argument and support for the corresponding `AWS_RETRY_MODE` environment variable to configure how retries are attempted. ([#33692](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33692))
                * `allowed_account_ids` and `forbidden_account_ids` arguments to prevent unintended modifications to specified environments. ([#33688](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33688))
            * backend/cos: Support custom HTTP(S) endpoint and root domain for the API client. ([#33656](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33656))

            BUG FIXES:
            * core: Transitive dependencies were lost during apply when the referenced resource expanded into zero instances. ([#33403](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33403))
            * cli: Terraform will no longer override SSH settings in local git configuration when installing modules. ([#33592](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33592))
            * `terraform` built-in provider: The upstream dependency that Terraform uses for service discovery of Terraform-native services such as Terraform Cloud/Enterprise state storage was previously not concurrency-safe, but Terraform was treating it as if it was in situations like when a configuration has multiple `terraform_remote_state` blocks all using the "remote" backend. Terraform is now using a newer version of that library which updates its internal caches in a concurrency-safe way. ([#33364](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33364))
            * `terraform init`: Terraform will no longer allow downloading remote modules to invalid paths. ([#33745](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33745))
            * Ignore potential remote terraform version mismatch when running force-unlock ([#28853](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28853))
            * cloud: Fixed a bug that would prevent nested symlinks from being dereferenced into the config sent to Terraform Cloud ([#31895](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/31895))

            ## 1.6.1 (October 10, 2023)

            ENHANCEMENTS:
            * backend/s3: The `skip_requesting_account_id` argument supports AWS API implementations that do not have the IAM, STS, or metadata API. ([#34002](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34002))

            BUG FIXES:
            * config: Using sensitive values as one or both of the results of a conditional expression will no longer crash. [GH-33996]
            * config: Conditional expression returning refined-non-null result will no longer crash. [GH-33996]
            * cli: Reverted back to previous behavior of ignoring signing key expiration for provider installation, since it's the provider registry's responsibility to verify key validity at publication time. [GH-34004]
            * cli: `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` is now preserved again when fetching modules from git source addresses. [GH-34045]
            * cloud: The `TF_WORKSPACE` environment variable works with the `cloud` block again; it can specify a workspace when none is configured, or select an active workspace when the config specifies `tags`. [GH-34012]
            * backend/s3: S3, DynamoDB, IAM, and STS endpoint parameters will no longer fail validation if the parsed scheme or hostname is empty. ([#34017](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34017))
            * backend/s3: Providing a key alias to the `kms_key_id` argument will no longer fail validation. ([#33993](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/33993))

            * Fix interoperability issues between v1.6 series and earlier series by removing variable validations from the state file ([#34058](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34058)).
            * cloud: Fixes panic when saving state in Terraform Cloud when certain types of API errors are returned ([#34074](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34074)).
            * config: Fix crash in conditional statements with certain combinations of unknown values. Improve handling of refined values into the conditional expression results ([#34096](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34096))

            ## 1.6.6 (December 13, 2023)

            BUG FIXES:
            * `terraform test`: Stop attempting to destroy run blocks that have no actual infrastructure to destroy. This fixes an issue where attempts to destroy "verification" run blocks that load only data sources would fail if the underlying infrastructure referenced by the run blocks had already been destroyed. ([#34331](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34331))
            * cloud: prevent running saved cloud plans in VCS-connected workspaces. Saved plans might be applied later, and VCS workspaces shouldn't apply configurations that don't come from their designated VCS branch.
            * core: Unmanaged plugins (mainly used by provider acceptance testing) would not have a provider address set, preventing the caching of their schemas ([#34380](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34380))

          body: "## 1.7.0 (January 17, 2024)\n\nUPGRADE NOTES:\n\n* Input validations
            are being restored to the state file in this version of Terraform. Due
            to a state interoperability issue ([#33770](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33770))
            in earlier versions, users that require interaction between different
            minor series should ensure they have upgraded to the following patches:\n
            \   * Users of Terraform prior to 1.3.0 are unaffected;\n    * Terraform
            1.3 series users should upgrade to 1.3.10;\n    * Terraform 1.4 series
            users should upgrade to 1.4.7;\n    * Terraform 1.5 series users should
            upgrade to 1.5.7;\n    * Users of Terraform 1.6.0 and later are unaffected.\n
            \n  This is important for users with `terraform_remote_state` data sources
            reading remote state across different versions of Terraform.\n* `nonsensitive`
            function no longer raises an error when applied to a value that is already
            non-sensitive. ([#33856](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33856))\n*
            `terraform graph` now produces a simplified graph describing only relationships
            between resources by default, for consistency with the granularity of
            information returned by other commands that emphasize resources as the
            main interesting object type and de-emphasize the other \"glue\" objects
            that connect them.\n\n    The type of graph that earlier versions of Terraform
            produced by default is still available with explicit use of the `-type=plan`
            option, producing an approximation of the real dependency graph Terraform
            Core would use to construct a plan.\n* `terraform test`: Simplify the
            ordering of destroy operations during test cleanup to simple reverse run
            block order. ([#34293](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34293))\n\n*
            backend/s3: The `use_legacy_workflow` argument now defaults to `false`.
            The backend will now search for credentials in the same order as the default
            provider chain in the AWS SDKs and AWS CLI. To revert to the legacy credential
            provider chain ordering, set this value to `true`. This argument, and
            the ability to use the legacy workflow, is deprecated. To encourage consistency
            with the AWS SDKs, this argument will be removed in a future minor version.\n\nNEW
            FEATURES:\n\n* `terraform test`: Providers, modules, resources, and data
            sources can now be mocked during executions of `terraform test`. The following
            new blocks have been introduced within `.tftest.hcl` files:\n\n    * `mock_provider`:
            Can replace provider instances with mocked providers, allowing tests to
            execute in `command = apply` mode without requiring a configured cloud
            provider account and credentials. Terraform will create fake resources
            for mocked providers and maintain them in state for the lifecycle of the
            given test file.\n    * `override_resource`: Specific resources can be
            overridden so Terraform will create a fake resource with custom values
            instead of creating infrastructure for the overridden resource.\n    *
            `override_data`: Specific data sources can be overridden so data can be
            imported into tests without requiring real infrastructure to be created
            externally first.\n    * `override_module`: Specific modules can be overridden
            in their entirety to give greater control over the returned outputs without
            requiring in-depth knowledge of the module itself.\n \n* `removed` block
            for refactoring modules: Module authors can now record in source code
            when a resource or module call has been removed from configuration, and
            can inform Terraform whether the corresponding object should be deleted
            or simply removed from state.\n  \n  This effectively provides a configuration-driven
            workflow to replace `terraform state rm`. Removing an object from state
            is a new type of action which is planned and applied like any other. The
            `terraform state rm` command will remain available for scenarios in which
            directly modifying the state file is appropriate.\n\nBUG FIXES:\n\n* Ignore
            potential remote terraform version mismatch when running force-unlock
            ([#28853](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/28853))\n* Exit
            Dockerfile build script early on `cd` failure. ([#34128](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34128))\n*
            `terraform test`: Stop attempting to destroy run blocks that have no actual
            infrastructure to destroy. This fixes an issue where attempts to destroy
            \"verification\" run blocks that load only data sources would fail if
            the underlying infrastructure referenced by the run blocks had already
            been destroyed. ([#34331](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34331))\n*
            `terraform test`: Improve error message for invalid run block names. ([#34469](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34469))\n*
            `terraform test`: Fix bug where outputs in \"empty\" modules were not
            available to the assertions from Terraform test files. ([#34482](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34482))\n*
            security: Upstream patch to mitigate the security advisory CVE-2023-48795,
            which potentially affects `local-exec` and `file` provisioners connecting
            to remote hosts using SSH. ([#34426](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34426))\n\nENHANCEMENTS:\n\n*
            `terraform test`: Providers defined within test files can now reference
            variables from their configuration that are defined within the test file.
            ([#34069](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34069))\n* `terraform
            test`: Providers defined within test files can now reference outputs from
            run blocks. ([#34118](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34118))\n*
            `terraform test`: Terraform functions are now available within variables
            and provider blocks within test files. ([#34204](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34204))\n*
            `terraform test`: Terraform will now load variables from any `terraform.tfvars`
            within the testing directory, and apply the variable values to tests within
            the same directory. ([#34341](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34341))\n*
            `terraform graph`: Now produces a simplified resources-only graph by default.
            ([#34288](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34288))\n* `terraform
            console`: Now supports a `-plan` option which allows evaluating expressions
            against the planned new state, rather than against the prior state. This
            provides a more complete set of values for use in console expressions,
            at the expense of a slower startup time due first calculating the plan.
            ([#34342](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34342))\n* `import`:
            `for_each` can now be used to expand the `import` block to handle multiple
            resource instances ([#33932](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/33932))\n*
            If the proposed change for a resource instance is rejected either due
            to a `postcondition` block or a `prevent_destroy` setting, Terraform will
            now include that proposed change in the plan output alongside the relevant
            error, whereas before the error would _replace_ the proposed change in
            the output. ([#34312](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34312))\n*
            `.terraformignore`: improve performance when ignoring large directories
            ([#34400](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34400))\n\n## Previous

            ## 1.7.2 (January 31, 2024)

            BUG FIXES:

            * backend/s3: No longer returns error when IAM user or role does not have access to the default workspace prefix `env:`. ([#34511](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34511))
            * cloud: When triggering a run, the .terraform/modules directory was being excluded from the configuration upload causing Terraform Cloud to try (and sometimes fail) to re-download the modules. ([#34543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34543))

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * `terraform fmt`: Terraform mock data files (`.tfmock.hcl`) will now be included when executing the format command. ([#34580](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34580))
            * Add additional diagnostics when a generated provider block that fails schema validation requires explicit configuration. ([#34595](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34595))

            ## 1.8.0 (April 10, 2024)

            If you are upgrading from Terraform v1.7 or earlier, please refer to
            [the Terraform v1.8 Upgrade Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.8.x/upgrade-guides).

            NEW FEATURES:

            * Providers can now offer functions which can be used from within the Terraform configuration language.

                The syntax for calling a provider-contributed function is `provider::provider_name::function_name()`. ([#34394](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34394))
            * Providers can now transfer the ownership of a remote object between resources of different types, for situations where there are two different resource types that represent the same remote object type.

                This extends the `moved` block behavior to support moving between two resources of different types only if the provider for the target resource type declares that it can convert from the source resource type. Refer to provider documentation for details on which pairs of resource types are supported.
            * New `issensitive` function returns true if the given value is marked as sensitive.

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * `terraform test`: File-level variables can now refer to global variables. ([#34699](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34699))
            * When generating configuration based on `import` blocks, Terraform will detect strings that contain valid JSON syntax and generate them as calls to the `jsonencode` function, rather than generating a single string. This is primarily motivated by readability, but might also be useful if you need to replace part of the literal value with an expression as you generalize your module beyond the one example used for importing.
            * `terraform plan` now uses a different presentation for describing changes to lists where the old and new lists have the same length. It now compares the elements with correlated indices and shows a separate diff for each one, rather than trying to show a diff for the list as a whole. The behavior is unchanged for lists of different lengths.
            * `terraform providers lock` accepts a new boolean option `-enable-plugin-cache`. If specified, and if a [global plugin cache](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/config/config-file#provider-plugin-cache) is configured, Terraform will use the cache in the provider lock process. ([#34632](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34632))
            * built-in "terraform" provider: new `decode_tfvars`, `encode_tfvars`, and `encode_expr` functions, for unusual situations where it's helpful to manually generate or read from Terraform's "tfvars" format. ([#34718](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34718))
            * `terraform show`'s JSON rendering of a plan now includes two explicit flags `"applyable"` and `"complete"`, which both summarize characteristics of a plan that were previously only inferrable by consumers replicating some of Terraform Core's own logic. ([#34642](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34642))

                `"applyable"` means that it makes sense for a wrapping automation to offer to apply this plan.

                `"complete"` means that applying this plan is expected to achieve convergence between desired and actual state. If this flag is present and set to `false` then wrapping automations should ideally encourage an operator to run another plan/apply round to continue making progress toward convergence.

            BUG FIXES:

            * core: Sensitive values will now be tracked more accurately in state and plans, preventing unexpected updates with no apparent changes. ([#34567](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34567))
            * core: Fix incorrect error message when using in invalid `iterator` argument within a dynamic block. ([#34751](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34751))
            * core: Fixed edge-case bug that could cause loss of floating point precision when round-tripping due to incorrectly using a MessagePack integer to represent a large non-integral number. ([#24576](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/24576))
            * config: Converting from an unknown map value to an object type now correctly handles the situation where the map element type disagrees with an optional attribute of the target type, since when a map value is unknown we don't yet know which keys it has and thus cannot predict what subset of the elements will get converted as attributes in the resulting object. ([#34756](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34756))
            * cloud: Fixed unparsed color codes in policy failure error messages. ([#34473](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34473))

            ## 1.8.2 (April 24, 2024)

            BUG FIXES:

            * `terraform apply`: Prevent panic when a provider erroneously provides unknown values. ([#35048](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35048))
            * `terraform plan`: Replace panic with error message when self-referencing resources and data sources from the `count` and `for_each` meta attributes. ([#35047](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35047))
            * `terraform test`: Restore `TF_ENV_*` variables being made available to testing modules. ([#35014](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35014))
            * `terraform test`: Prevent crash when referencing local variables within overridden modules. ([#35030](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35030))

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * Improved performance by removing unneeded additional computation for a disabled experimental feature. ([#35066](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35066))

            OTHER CHANGES:

            * Update all references to Terraform Cloud to refer to HCP Terraform, the service's new name. This only affects display text; the `cloud` block and environment variables like `TF_CLOUD_ORGANIZATION` remain unchanged. ([#35050](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35050))

            NOTE:

            Starting with this release, we are including a copy of our license file in all packaged versions of our releases, such as the release .zip files. If you are consuming these files directly and would prefer to extract the one terraform file instead of extracting everything, you need to add an extra argument specifying the file to extract, like this:
            ```
            unzip terraform_1.8.2_linux_amd64.zip terraform
            ```

            ## 1.9.0 (June 26, 2024)

            If you are upgrading from an earlier minor release, please refer to [the Terraform v1.9 Upgrade Guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1.9.x/upgrade-guides).

            NEW FEATURES:

            * **Input variable validation rules can refer to other objects**: Previously input variable validation rules could refer only to the variable being validated. Now they are general expressions, similar to those elsewhere in a module, which can refer to other input variables and to other objects such as data resources.
            * **`templatestring` function**: a new built-in function which is similar to `templatefile` but designed to render templates obtained dynamically, such as from a data resource result.

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * `terraform plan`: Improved presentation of OPA and Sentinel policy evaluations in HCP Terraform remote runs, for logical separation.
            * `terraform init` now accepts a `-json` option. If specified, enables the machine readable JSON output. ([#34886](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34886))
            * `terraform test`: Test runs can now pass sensitive values to input variables while preserving their dynamic sensitivity. Previously sensitivity would be preserved only for variables statically declared as being sensitive, using `sensitive = true`. ([#35021](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35021))
            * config: Input variable validation rules can now refer to other objects in the same module. ([#34955](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34955))
            * config: `templatestring` function allows rendering a template provided as a string. ([#34968](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34968), [#35224](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35224), [#35285](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35285))
            * core: Performance improvement during graph building for configurations with an extremely large number of `resource` blocks. ([#35088](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35088))
            * built-in `terraform` provider: Allows `moved` block refactoring from the `hashicorp/null` provider `null_resource` resource type to the `terraform_data` resource type. ([#35163](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35163))
            * `terraform output` with `cloud` block: Terraform no longer suggests that data loss could occur when outputs are not available. ([#35143](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35143))
            * `terraform console`: Now has basic support for multi-line input in interactive mode. ([#34822](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/34822))
                If an entered line contains opening parentheses/etc that are not closed, Terraform will await another line of input to complete the expression. This initial implementation is primarily intended to support pasting in multi-line expressions from elsewhere, rather than for manual multi-line editing, so the interactive editing support is currently limited.
            * cli: Reduced copying of state to improve performance with large numbers of resources. ([#35164](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35164))
            * `removed` blocks can now declare destroy-time provisioners which will be executed when the associated resource instances are destroyed. ([#35230](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35230))

            BUG FIXES:

            * `remote-exec` provisioner: Each remote connection will now be closed immediately after use. ([#34137](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34137))
            * backend/s3: Fixed the digest value displayed for DynamoDB/S3 state checksum mismatches. ([#34387](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/34387))
            * `terraform test`: Fix bug in which non-Hashicorp providers required by testing modules and initialised within the test files were assigned incorrect registry addresses. ([#35161](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35161))
            * config: The `templatefile` function no longer returns a "panic" error if the template file path is marked as sensitive. Instead, the template rendering result is also marked as sensitive. ([#35180](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35180))
            * config: `import` blocks which referenced resources in non-existent modules were silently ignored when they should have raised an error ([#35330](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35330))
            * `terraform init`: When selecting a version for a provider that has both positive and negative version constraints for the same prerelease -- e.g. `1.2.0-beta.1, !1.2.0-beta.1` -- the negative constraint will now overrule the positive, for consistency with how negative constraints are handled otherwise. Previously Terraform would incorrectly treat the positive as overriding the negative if the specified version was a prerelease. ([#35181](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35181))
            * `import`: `import` blocks could block a destroy operation if the target resource was already deleted ([#35272](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35272))
            * `cli`: plan output was missing blocks which were entirely unknown ([#35271](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35271))
            * `cli`: fix crash when running `providers mirror` with an incomplete lock file ([#35322](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35322))
            * core: Changing `create_before_destroy` when replacing an instance, then applying with `-refresh=false` would order the apply operations incorrectly ([#35261](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35261))
            * core: Resource addresses that start with the optional `resource.` prefix will now be correctly parsed when used as an address target. ([#35333](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35333))

            UPGRADE NOTES:

            * `terraform test`: It is no longer valid to specify version constraints within provider blocks within .tftest.hcl files. Instead, version constraints must be supplied within the main configuration where the provider is in use.
            * `import`: Invalid `import` blocks pointing to nonexistent modules were mistakenly ignored in prior versions. These will need to be fixed or removed in v1.9.

            ## 1.9.3 (July 24, 2024)

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            * Terraform now returns a more specific error message in the awkward situation where an input variable validation rule is known to have failed (`condition` returned `false`) but the error message is derived from an unknown value. ([#35400](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35400))

            BUG FIXES:

            * core: Terraform no longer performs an unnecessary refresh when removing an instance targeted by a `removed` block. ([#35458](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35458))
            * config generation: Fix validation error when using nested computed or deprecated attributes. ([#35484](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35484))
            * Updated to newer github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp version, addressing CVE-2024-6104, and bringing in updates for several indirect dependencies. ([#35473](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35473))
            * Moved to building with Go 1.22.5, which addresses CVE-2024-24791 and several other non-security bugs. ([#35494](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35494))

            ## 1.10.0 (November 27, 2024)

            NEW FEATURES:
             - **Ephemeral resources**: Ephemeral resources are read anew during each phase of Terraform evaluation, and cannot be persisted to state storage. Ephemeral resources always produce ephemeral values.
             - **Ephemeral values**: Input variables and outputs can now be defined as ephemeral. Ephemeral values may only be used in certain contexts in Terraform configuration, and are not persisted to the plan or state files.
                - **`ephemeralasnull` function**: a function takes a value of any type and returns a similar value of the same type with any ephemeral values replaced with non-ephemeral null values and all non-ephemeral values preserved.

            BUG FIXES:

            - The `secret_suffix` in the `kubernetes` backend now includes validation to prevent errors when the `secret_suffix` ends with a number ([#35666](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35666)).
            - The error message for an invalid default value for an input variable now indicates when the problem is with a nested value in a complex data type. ([#35465](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35465))
            - Sensitive marks could be incorrectly transferred to nested resource values, causing erroneous changes during a plan ([#35501](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35501))
            - Allow unknown `error_message` values to pass the core validate step, so variable validation can be completed later during plan
              ([#35537](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35537))
            - Unencoded slashes within GitHub module source refs were being truncated and incorrectly used as subdirectories in the request path ([#35552](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35552))
            - Terraform refresh-only plans with output only changes are now applyable. ([#35812](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35812))
            - Postconditions referencing `self` with many instances could encounter an error during evaluation ([#35895](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35895))
            - The `plantimestamp()` function would return an invalid date during validation ([#35902](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35902))
            - Updates to resources which were forced to use create_before_destroy could lose that flag in the state temporarily and cause cycles if immediately removed from the configuration ([#35966](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35966))
            - backend/cloud: Prefer KV tags, even when tags are defined as set ([#35937](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35937))
            - Simplify config generation (`plan -generate-config-out`) for string attributes that contain primitive types (e.g. numbers or booleans) ([#35984](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35984))
            - config: `issensitive` could incorrectly assert that an unknown value was not sensitive during plan, but later became sensitive during apply, causing failures where changes did not match the planned result ([#36012](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/36012))
            - config: The evaluation of conditional expressions and for expression in HCL could lose marks with certain combinations of unknown values ([#36017](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/36017))

            ENHANCEMENTS:

            - The `element` function now accepts negative indices ([#35501](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35501))
            - Import block validation has been improved to provide more useful errors and catch more invalid cases during `terraform validate` ([#35543](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35543))
            - Performance enhancements for resource evaluation, especially when large numbers of resource instances are involved ([#35558](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35558))
            - The `plan`, `apply`, and `refresh` commands now produce a deprecated warning when using the `-state` flag. Instead use the `path` attribute within the `local` backend to modify the state file. ([#35660](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35660))
            - backend/cos: Add new auth for Tencent Cloud backend ([#35888](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/35888))

            UPGRADE NOTES:

            - backend/s3: Removes deprecated attributes for assuming IAM role. Must use the `assume_role` block ([#35721](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35721))
            - backend/s3: The s3 backend now supports S3 native state locking. When used with DynamoDB-based locking, locks will be acquired from both sources. In a future minor release of Terraform the DynamoDB locking mechanism and associated arguments will be deprecated. ([#35661](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35661))
            - `moved`: Moved blocks now respect reserved keywords when parsing resource addresses. Configurations that reference resources with type names that match top level blocks and keywords from `moved` blocks will need to prepend the `resource.` identifier to these references. ([#35850](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/35850))
            - config: In order to ensure consistency in results from HCL conditional expressions, marks must be combined from all values within the expression to avoid losing mark information. This typically improves accuracy when validating configuration, but users may see sensitive results where they were lost previously.
