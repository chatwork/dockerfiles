          body: "## Note from the Maintainers\r\n\r\nWe are extremely happy to introduce
            this new minor release of SOPS, now a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) Sandbox
            project under the stewardship of a new [group of maintainers](https://github.com/getsops/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).\r\n\r\nThis
            release involved significant effort in rewriting and enhancing key source
            implementations, and includes a number of bug fixes which people had been
            patiently waiting on for a long period of time. In addition, the release
            process has been built up from scratch, and now now provides enhanced
            assurance by publishing SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), [SLSA3 provenance
            attestations](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance) and a Cosign signed
            checksums file as release artifacts.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive list of
            changes, please refer to [`CHANGELOG.rst`](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/v3.8.0/CHANGELOG.rst).\r\n\r\n###
            Important Information for SOPS SDK Users\r\n\r\nWith the project transitioning
            from the Mozilla Foundation to the CNCF, the Go module path has been updated
            to reflect this change in ownership. If you use `go.mozilla.org/sops/v3`
            as a library, going forward, import the Go Module using `github.com/getsops/sops/v3`.
            Apart from this small adjustment, the SDK's API remains fully backward
            compatible.\r\n\r\nFor a one-liner to quickly implement this change throughout
            your codebase, please refer to: https://github.com/getsops/sops/issues/1246#issuecomment-1625526429\r\n\r\n##
            Installation\r\n\r\nTo install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries
            provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.\r\n\r\nFor
            instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n#
            Download the binary\r\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.linux.amd64\r\n\r\n#
            Move the binary in to your PATH\r\nmv sops-v3.8.0.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops\r\n\r\n#
            Make the binary executable\r\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify checksums file signature\r\n\r\nThe checksums file provided within
            the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)
            with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following
            commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Download the checksums file, certificate
            and signature\r\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt\r\ncurl
            -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.pem\r\ncurl
            -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.sig\r\n\r\n#
            Verify the checksums file\r\ncosign verify-blob sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt
            \\\r\n  --certificate sops-v3.8.0.checksums.pem \\\r\n  --signature sops-v3.8.0.checksums.sig
            \\\r\n  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \\\r\n
            \ --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify binary integrity\r\n\r\nTo verify the integrity of the downloaded
            binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its
            signature:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Verify the binary using the checksums
            file\r\nsha256sum -c sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt --ignore-missing\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify artifact provenance\r\n\r\nThe [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2)
            of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts
            associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/)
            link metadata file named `sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance
            of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts)
            tool:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Download the metadata file\r\ncurl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl\r\n\r\n#
            Verify the provenance of the artifact\r\nslsa-verifier verify-artifact
            <artifact> \\\r\n  --provenance-path sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl \\\r\n  --source-uri
            github.com/getsops/sops \\\r\n  --source-tag v3.8.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Container
            Images\r\n\r\nThe `sops` binaries are also available as container images,
            based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images
            include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain
            key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud
            KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not
            include these dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese container images are available
            for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.\r\n\r\n###
            GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\n- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0`\r\n-
            `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0-alpine`\r\n\r\n### Quay.io\r\n\r\n- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0`\r\n-
            `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0-alpine`\r\n\r\n### Verify container image
            signature\r\n\r\nThe container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)
            with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following
            command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0
            \\\r\n  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \\\r\n
            \ --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            \\\r\n  -o text\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verify container image provenance\r\n\r\nThe
            container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2)
            attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please
            refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).\r\n\r\n##
