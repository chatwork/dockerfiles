        ## Installation

        To install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.

        For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:

        ```shell
        # Download the binary
        curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.linux.amd64

        # Move the binary in to your PATH
        mv sops-v3.9.1.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops

        # Make the binary executable
        chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
        ```

        ### Verify checksums file signature

        The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:

        ```shell
        # Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
        curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt
        curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.pem
        curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.sig

        # Verify the checksums file
        cosign verify-blob sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt \
          --certificate sops-v3.9.1.checksums.pem \
          --signature sops-v3.9.1.checksums.sig \
          --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
          --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
        ```

        ### Verify binary integrity

        To verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:

        ```shell
        # Verify the binary using the checksums file
        sha256sum -c sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt --ignore-missing
        ```

        ### Verify artifact provenance

        The [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) link metadata file named `sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts) tool:

        ```shell
        # Download the metadata file
        curl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl

        # Verify the provenance of the artifact
        slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \
          --provenance-path sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl \
          --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \
          --source-tag v3.9.1
        ```

        ## Container Images

        The `sops` binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.

        These container images are available for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

        ### GitHub Container Registry

        - `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1`
        - `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1-alpine`

        ### Quay.io

        - `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1`
        - `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1-alpine`

        ### Verify container image signature

        The container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:

        ```shell
        cosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1 \
          --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
          --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
          -o text
        ```

        ### Verify container image provenance

        The container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).

        ## Software Bill of Materials

        The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each binary is accessible within the artifacts enclosed with this release. It is presented as an [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) JSON file, formatted as `<binary>.spdx.sbom.json`.

          body: "## Note from the Maintainers\r\n\r\nWe are extremely happy to introduce
            this new minor release of SOPS, now a [CNCF](https://cncf.io) Sandbox
            project under the stewardship of a new [group of maintainers](https://github.com/getsops/community/blob/main/MAINTAINERS.md).\r\n\r\nThis
            release involved significant effort in rewriting and enhancing key source
            implementations, and includes a number of bug fixes which people had been
            patiently waiting on for a long period of time. In addition, the release
            process has been built up from scratch, and now now provides enhanced
            assurance by publishing SBOMs (Software Bill of Materials), [SLSA3 provenance
            attestations](https://slsa.dev/spec/v0.1/provenance) and a Cosign signed
            checksums file as release artifacts.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive list of
            changes, please refer to [`CHANGELOG.rst`](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/v3.8.0/CHANGELOG.rst).\r\n\r\n###
            Important Information for SOPS SDK Users\r\n\r\nWith the project transitioning
            from the Mozilla Foundation to the CNCF, the Go module path has been updated
            to reflect this change in ownership. If you use `go.mozilla.org/sops/v3`
            as a library, going forward, import the Go Module using `github.com/getsops/sops/v3`.
            Apart from this small adjustment, the SDK's API remains fully backward
            compatible.\r\n\r\nFor a one-liner to quickly implement this change throughout
            your codebase, please refer to: https://github.com/getsops/sops/issues/1246#issuecomment-1625526429\r\n\r\n##
            Installation\r\n\r\nTo install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries
            provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.\r\n\r\nFor
            instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n#
            Download the binary\r\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.linux.amd64\r\n\r\n#
            Move the binary in to your PATH\r\nmv sops-v3.8.0.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops\r\n\r\n#
            Make the binary executable\r\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify checksums file signature\r\n\r\nThe checksums file provided within
            the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)
            with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following
            commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Download the checksums file, certificate
            and signature\r\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt\r\ncurl
            -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.pem\r\ncurl
            -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.checksums.sig\r\n\r\n#
            Verify the checksums file\r\ncosign verify-blob sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt
            \\\r\n  --certificate sops-v3.8.0.checksums.pem \\\r\n  --signature sops-v3.8.0.checksums.sig
            \\\r\n  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \\\r\n
            \ --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify binary integrity\r\n\r\nTo verify the integrity of the downloaded
            binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its
            signature:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Verify the binary using the checksums
            file\r\nsha256sum -c sops-v3.8.0.checksums.txt --ignore-missing\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify artifact provenance\r\n\r\nThe [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2)
            of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts
            associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/)
            link metadata file named `sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance
            of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts)
            tool:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Download the metadata file\r\ncurl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.0/sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl\r\n\r\n#
            Verify the provenance of the artifact\r\nslsa-verifier verify-artifact
            <artifact> \\\r\n  --provenance-path sops-v3.8.0.intoto.jsonl \\\r\n  --source-uri
            github.com/getsops/sops \\\r\n  --source-tag v3.8.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Container
            Images\r\n\r\nThe `sops` binaries are also available as container images,
            based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images
            include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain
            key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud
            KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not
            include these dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese container images are available
            for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.\r\n\r\n###
            GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\n- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0`\r\n-
            `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0-alpine`\r\n\r\n### Quay.io\r\n\r\n- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0`\r\n-
            `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0-alpine`\r\n\r\n### Verify container image
            signature\r\n\r\nThe container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)
            with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following
            command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.0
            \\\r\n  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \\\r\n
            \ --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            \\\r\n  -o text\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verify container image provenance\r\n\r\nThe
            container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2)
            attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please
            refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).\r\n\r\n##

          body: "## Note from the Maintainers\r\n\r\nIn this release of SOPS, we have
            focused on landing a variety of bug fixes to improve the overall user
            experience.\r\n\r\nFor a comprehensive list of changes, please refer to
            [`CHANGELOG.rst`](https://github.com/getsops/sops/blob/v3.8.1/CHANGELOG.rst).\r\n\r\n###
            Important Information for SOPS SDK Users\r\n\r\nWith the project transitioning
            from the Mozilla Foundation to the CNCF, the Go module path has been updated
            to reflect this change in ownership. If you use `go.mozilla.org/sops/v3`
            as a library, going forward, import the Go Module using `github.com/getsops/sops/v3`.
            Apart from this small adjustment, the SDK's API remains fully backward
            compatible.\r\n\r\nFor a one-liner to quickly implement this change throughout
            your codebase, please refer to: https://github.com/getsops/sops/issues/1246#issuecomment-1625526429\r\n\r\n##
            Installation\r\n\r\nTo install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries
            provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.\r\n\r\nFor
            instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n#
            Download the binary\r\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.1/sops-v3.8.1.linux.amd64\r\n\r\n#
            Move the binary in to your PATH\r\nmv sops-v3.8.1.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops\r\n\r\n#
            Make the binary executable\r\nchmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify checksums file signature\r\n\r\nThe checksums file provided within
            the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)
            with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following
            commands:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Download the checksums file, certificate
            and signature\r\ncurl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.1/sops-v3.8.1.checksums.txt\r\ncurl
            -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.1/sops-v3.8.1.checksums.pem\r\ncurl
            -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.1/sops-v3.8.1.checksums.sig\r\n\r\n#
            Verify the checksums file\r\ncosign verify-blob sops-v3.8.1.checksums.txt
            \\\r\n  --certificate sops-v3.8.1.checksums.pem \\\r\n  --signature sops-v3.8.1.checksums.sig
            \\\r\n  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \\\r\n
            \ --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify binary integrity\r\n\r\nTo verify the integrity of the downloaded
            binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its
            signature:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Verify the binary using the checksums
            file\r\nsha256sum -c sops-v3.8.1.checksums.txt --ignore-missing\r\n```\r\n\r\n###
            Verify artifact provenance\r\n\r\nThe [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2)
            of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts
            associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/)
            link metadata file named `sops-v3.8.1.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance
            of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts)
            tool:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\n# Download the metadata file\r\ncurl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.8.1/sops-v3.8.1.intoto.jsonl\r\n\r\n#
            Verify the provenance of the artifact\r\nslsa-verifier verify-artifact
            <artifact> \\\r\n  --provenance-path sops-v3.8.1.intoto.jsonl \\\r\n  --source-uri
            github.com/getsops/sops \\\r\n  --source-tag v3.8.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Container
            Images\r\n\r\nThe `sops` binaries are also available as container images,
            based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images
            include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain
            key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud
            KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not
            include these dependencies.\r\n\r\nThese container images are available
            for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.\r\n\r\n###
            GitHub Container Registry\r\n\r\n- `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.1`\r\n-
            `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.1-alpine`\r\n\r\n### Quay.io\r\n\r\n- `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.1`\r\n-
            `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.1-alpine`\r\n\r\n### Verify container image
            signature\r\n\r\nThe container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/)
            with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following
            command:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.8.1
            \\\r\n  --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \\\r\n
            \ --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            \\\r\n  -o text\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Verify container image provenance\r\n\r\nThe
            container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2)
            attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please
            refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).\r\n\r\n##
            Software Bill of Materials\r\n\r\nThe Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)
            for each binary is accessible within the artifacts enclosed with this
            release. It is presented as an [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) JSON file, formatted

            ## Installation

            To install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.

            For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:

            ```shell
            # Download the binary
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.linux.amd64

            # Move the binary in to your PATH
            mv sops-v3.9.0.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops

            # Make the binary executable
            chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
            ```

            ### Verify checksums file signature

            The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:

            ```shell
            # Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.checksums.txt
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.checksums.pem
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.checksums.sig

            # Verify the checksums file
            cosign verify-blob sops-v3.9.0.checksums.txt \
              --certificate sops-v3.9.0.checksums.pem \
              --signature sops-v3.9.0.checksums.sig \
              --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
              --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            ```

            ### Verify binary integrity

            To verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:

            ```shell
            # Verify the binary using the checksums file
            sha256sum -c sops-v3.9.0.checksums.txt --ignore-missing
            ```

            ### Verify artifact provenance

            The [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) link metadata file named `sops-v3.9.0.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts) tool:

            ```shell
            # Download the metadata file
            curl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.0/sops-v3.9.0.intoto.jsonl

            # Verify the provenance of the artifact
            slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \
              --provenance-path sops-v3.9.0.intoto.jsonl \
              --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \
              --source-tag v3.9.0
            ```

            ## Container Images

            The `sops` binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.

            These container images are available for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

            ### GitHub Container Registry

            - `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0`
            - `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0-alpine`

            ### Quay.io

            - `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0`
            - `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0-alpine`

            ### Verify container image signature

            The container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:

            ```shell
            cosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.0 \
              --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
              --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
              -o text
            ```

            ### Verify container image provenance

            ## Installation

            To install `sops`, download one of the pre-built binaries provided for your platform from the artifacts attached to this release.

            For instance, if you are using Linux on an AMD64 architecture:

            ```shell
            # Download the binary
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.linux.amd64

            # Move the binary in to your PATH
            mv sops-v3.9.1.linux.amd64 /usr/local/bin/sops

            # Make the binary executable
            chmod +x /usr/local/bin/sops
            ```

            ### Verify checksums file signature

            The checksums file provided within the artifacts attached to this release is signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of this file, run the following commands:

            ```shell
            # Download the checksums file, certificate and signature
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.pem
            curl -LO https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.checksums.sig

            # Verify the checksums file
            cosign verify-blob sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt \
              --certificate sops-v3.9.1.checksums.pem \
              --signature sops-v3.9.1.checksums.sig \
              --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
              --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com
            ```

            ### Verify binary integrity

            To verify the integrity of the downloaded binary, you can utilize the checksums file after having validated its signature:

            ```shell
            # Verify the binary using the checksums file
            sha256sum -c sops-v3.9.1.checksums.txt --ignore-missing
            ```

            ### Verify artifact provenance

            The [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) of the binaries, packages, and SBOMs can be found within the artifacts associated with this release. It is presented through an [in-toto](https://in-toto.io/) link metadata file named `sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl`. To verify the provenance of an artifact, you can utilize the [`slsa-verifier`](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#artifacts) tool:

            ```shell
            # Download the metadata file
            curl -LO  https://github.com/getsops/sops/releases/download/v3.9.1/sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl

            # Verify the provenance of the artifact
            slsa-verifier verify-artifact <artifact> \
              --provenance-path sops-v3.9.1.intoto.jsonl \
              --source-uri github.com/getsops/sops \
              --source-tag v3.9.1
            ```

            ## Container Images

            The `sops` binaries are also available as container images, based on Debian (slim) and Alpine Linux. The Debian-based container images include any dependencies which may be required to make use of certain key services, such as GnuPG, AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, and Google Cloud KMS. The Alpine-based container images are smaller in size, but do not include these dependencies.

            These container images are available for the following architectures: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`.

            ### GitHub Container Registry

            - `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1`
            - `ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1-alpine`

            ### Quay.io

            - `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1`
            - `quay.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1-alpine`

            ### Verify container image signature

            The container images are signed using [Cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) with GitHub OIDC. To validate the signature of an image, run the following command:

            ```shell
            cosign verify ghcr.io/getsops/sops:v3.9.1 \
              --certificate-identity-regexp=https://github.com/getsops \
              --certificate-oidc-issuer=https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
              -o text
            ```

            ### Verify container image provenance

            The container images include [SLSA provenance](https://slsa.dev/provenance/v0.2) attestations. For more information around the verification of this, please refer to the [`slsa-verifier` documentation](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-verifier#containers).

            ## Software Bill of Materials

            The Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for each binary is accessible within the artifacts enclosed with this release. It is presented as an [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/) JSON file, formatted as `<binary>.spdx.sbom.json`.
